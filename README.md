## Greetings ğŸ‘‹

### About me
ğŸŒ± I'm currently self-studying data analysis and seek to utilise Github to demonstrate some of my projects. I am a seasoned Quality Engineer within manufacturing where, over the years, I have honed my skills in data analysis and the ability to tell a story using data. With Github, I seek to develop my technical skills to complement my current abilities to further pursue a career in Tech.
